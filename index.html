    <p>Football is one of my Favourite hobbies because I find the game active, energtic, interesting and strategic. It's a treally active game which is good as it keeps us healthy. There is so much to learn in it, how to pass, how to take the ball thorugh and learn how to do several tricks. Football requires co-operation, teamwork and alert attention. It also depends on how you plan the game. You even need Understand where your teamplayer is going to pass the ball, to who he going to pass the ball and fom where the person is going to shoot he ball aiming it on the goal.   </p>
